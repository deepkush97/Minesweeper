# Minesweeper

A Simple fun little project to understand the barebone logic of minesweeper. [Tutorial Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0No1JDc6vE)

What I have learnt in this project
- Minesweeper logic (I didn't know how to play before, but now developed and get the logivc to do so. 😁)
- Power of reduce, map and array functions. 💪
